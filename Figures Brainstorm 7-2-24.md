1A: Schematic - drop of water - isolates - 3/2 effect of Pro - clade
1B: Nanopore schematic - extrachromosomal capacity(important that used nanopore bc of extrachromosomal elements)

Figure 2
2A assembly (schematic)
2B phylogeny
2C schematic of extrachromosomal elements
(Supplementary table; full genome table)

Figure 3
3A: schematic of the network percolation
- how this relates the presented results - biomass and metabolites in network
3B: would be results - producibility?
3C: Networks that show the pathway we are mentioning

Figure 4
4A: structure of extrachromosomal elements
4B pangenome 
4C: properties 

conclude - cannot link to specific reason for prochlorococcus effects but here are some hypotheses that stem from our analysis and for future studies

specific links for data and analysis
